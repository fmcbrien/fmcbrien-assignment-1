<!-- ASSIGNMENT 1 -->
## Assignment 1

* The user of your module are other developers.
* Mission of the module:  If the user gives you two arrays of geo location, match each point in the first array to the closest one in the second array
  * Research and find the right formula for distance between two GPS locations.
* Restrictions
  * No questions to the TA
  * No questions to the instructor
  * All in Github (assignment to give Github in blackboard)
* Must be completed before class on Thursday since we will be using your work during the class

<!-- RUNNING THE CODE -->
## Running the Code

### Requirements
* Python 3

### Implementation
* Clone the repository
* cd into the correct folder
* run script fmcbrien-assignment-1.py
* Enter the GPS coordinates longitude and latitude separated by commas (",") and separate GPS values by spaces for the first and second arrays
  * Ex: "latitude1,longitude1 latitude2,longitude2"
* Observe results
